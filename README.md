## Notes

### **Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:**

The challenge mostly came from finding where exactly to fit the different pieces of the app. Additionally, implementing the weather particles was a bit confusing at first as well. Once that was sorted though, it was just a matter of making sure everything looked relatively nice.
